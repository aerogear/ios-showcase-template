== Work with Different Backend Services

By default the app will use the backend services that are running on https://security.skunkhenry.com:8443[a dedicated OpenShift cluster] for demonstration purpose. 

You can also configure the app to run against different backend services:

1. Update the URLs in link:secure-ios-app/AppConfig.plist[AppConfig.plist] file.
2. If you are using HTTPS, update the certificate pinning configuration in link:secure-ios-app/AppDelegate.swift[AppDelegate.swift] file

To generate the hash value of the certificate, you can use this command:
[source, bash]
----
openssl s_client -servername <hostname> -connect <hostname:port> | openssl x509 -pubkey -noout | openssl pkey -pubin -outform der | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | openssl enc -base64
----

If you are using self-signed certificate, follow the instructions in the next section.

== Work with Self-signed Certificate

The easiest way to support self-signed certificate is to install the CA certificate that is used to sign the certificate onto the device/simulator.

1. Get the CA certificate of the server. You can use this command:
+
[source, bash]
----
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect host:port
---- 
+
It will print out the full certificate chain of the server and you should save the content of the root certificate into a PEM file.

2. Install the CA certificate onto the device.
+
To install onto an iOS simulator, you can simply drag & drop the certificate file over it.
+
To install on an actual device, you can use a file sharing service or send the certificate file as an email attachment.

3. Ensure the newly installed CA certificate is trusted. 
+
On the device/simulator, go to `Settings -> General -> About -> Certificate Trust Settings` and enable full trust for the certificate.
