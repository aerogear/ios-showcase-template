=== Troubleshooting

==== Enabling Push Capabilites

If you wish to use push on the showcase application you will need to enable the push capability. 
To do this, go to ios-showcase-template and under `Capabilities` enable `Remote Notifications`

NOTE: You will need an Apple developer account with the push capability for this.

NOTE: Currently, it is not possible to use push notifications with a simulator.

==== Running on a real device
If you are running the application on a real device you will need to create a provisioning 
profile. To do this, go to ios-showcase-template and under `General` and then `Signing` select your desired 
profile if you already have one, and if not click `Add an Account` to create one.
